Heavenly - an awesome color scheme for putty

For folks who use Putty (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) to connect to linux/unix boxes, and code a lot, good news, you can have this awesome color scheme created by me to make your putty experience super fun.

I have seen so many color schemes for iTerm and others, but I could not find much for putty. It's either that people have created schemes of their own but did not bother to share with others, or no body cares.

Anyways, as I code a lot, I needed something that's not mundane, rather full of colors. So here I am, created my own color scheme to revolutionaize my putty experince.

The monospaced font in the screen shots is Source Code Pro from Adobe (https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro). I am using Medium and size 10 of this font.

It really looks cool!! Enjoy :)

NOTE: I have made a few modifications to putty:
1. Scrollback lines - 5000
2. No scrollback bar
3. No bell
